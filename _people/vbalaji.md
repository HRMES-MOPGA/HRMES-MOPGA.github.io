Dr. [V. Balaji](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/v-balaji-homepage/) has headed the Modeling Systems Division at NOAA/GFDL since 2004, with appointments in Princeton University's Cooperative Institute for Modeling the Earth System (CIMES), and associate faculty at the Princeton Institute for Computational Science and Engineering (PICSciE) and the Princeton Environmental Institute (PEI). With a background in physics and climate science, he has also become an expert in the area of parallel computing and scientific infrastructure. He serves on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Science Review Group of the UK Met Office Hadley Centre, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. He is a sought-after speaker and lecturer and is committed to provide training in the use of climate models in developing nations, leading workshops for advanced students and researchers in South Africa and India.

In 2017, he was among the first recipients of French President Macron's _Make Our Planet Great Again_ award marking the second anniversary of the Paris Climate Accord. He is currently a visiting scientist at the Laboratoire des Sciences de Climat et Environnement (LSCE) and the Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (IPSL), in Paris. He leads MOPGA Project Herm√®s.
