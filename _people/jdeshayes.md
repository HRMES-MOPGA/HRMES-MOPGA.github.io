Dr. Julie Deshayes co-leads the ocean component of Project Herm√®s alongside V. Balaji. CNRS permanent researcher since 2009, she has been the leader of the NEMO R&D team at LOCEAN from 2015 to 2020 (13 permanent scientists, up to 20 collaborators in total). She is internationally recognized through her work with NEMO, particularly in the preparation of global configurations for CMIP6  (at 1 deg. and 1/4 deg. resolution), and as such was invited to join the scientific board of the UKESM and CLIVAR Ocean Model Development Panel, and to serve as co-PI of EU projects (e.g. FP7 EMBRACE, FEDER CARIBCOAST). In 2019, she has been granted 50M CPU hours from PRACE to explore Uncertainty Quantification with IPSL-CM6A-LR, to complemeent CMIP6 simulations submitted to ESGF.
