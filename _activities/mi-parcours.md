The Project Hermès *mi-parcours* (HRMES Mid-Term Workshop) was held virtually on 29 January 2021. V. Balaji presented an [introductory talk](/files/mopga-mi-parcours.pdf). The talk outlined the goals of Project Hermès as outlined in the [kickoff meeting](/files/mopga-kickoff.pdf) in February 2019, using techniques from *machine learning* to build *supermodels* (where some model components are replaced by learning agents) and *metamodels* (low-dimensional emulators, or "fast approximate models" that can be used for exploring a model's dependency on its parameters. In addition to its scientific thrusts, Project Hermès articulated the goals of *building an interdisciplinary community* of scientists equally at home in machine learning and Earth System Science.

The meeting was attended by, among others, Philippe Bousquet, Director LSCE, Olivier Boucher, Deputy Directory IPSL, Julie Deshayes LOCEAN, Imène Tabbi-Anneni and Yvan Lagadeuc, ANR. The project is on track toward its goals as outlined during the [kickoff meeting](/files/mopga-kickoff.pdf).
