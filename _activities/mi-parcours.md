The Project Hermès *mi-parcours* (HRMES Mid-Term Workshop) was held virtually on 29 January 2021. V. Balaji presented an [introductory talk](/files/mopga-mi-parcours.pdf). The talk outlined the goals of Project Hermès as outlined in the [kickoff meeting](/files/mopga-kickoff.pdf) in February 2019, using techniques from *machine learning* to build *supermodels* (where some model components are replaced by learning agents) and *metamodels* (low-dimensional emulators, or "fast approximate models" that can be used for exploring a model's dependency on its parameters. In addition to its scientific thrusts, Project Hermès articulated the goals of *building an interdisciplinary community* of scientists equally at home in machine learning and Earth System Science.
